# cform

## Overview

cForm is a fullstack social media style app that allows users to post/blob about cryptocurrencies. This app uses the CoinMarketCap API to get the latest prices of the top cryptocurrencies and has a page that gets the current top 30 performing cryptocurrencies. Currently cForm is in a MVP state with future plans to allow user to add a profile picture, bio, list of their favorite crypto, and the ability to add friends. This app is live and deployed to Heroku. 

The insperation for this project comes from a pervious project that I was a part of which you can view [here](https://github.com/justbytes/CRYPTOPUNX-PRJ2). I converted the old project that used handlebars.js to now use React.js along with some modern bootstrap.
